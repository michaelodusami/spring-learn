### **1. @Getter**
- **What it does**: Automatically generates getter methods for all non-static fields of the class.
- **Why it is useful**: Eliminates boilerplate code for writing getters manually.
- **When and where to use it**: 
  - Use at the class level to generate getters for all fields.
  - Use at the field level to generate a getter for a specific field.

---

### **2. @Setter**
- **What it does**: Automatically generates setter methods for all non-final fields of the class.
- **Why it is useful**: Reduces boilerplate code for writing setters.
- **When and where to use it**:
  - Use at the class level to generate setters for all fields.
  - Use at the field level to generate a setter for a specific field.
- **Caution**: Use selectively, as allowing setters on all fields can break immutability or encapsulation.

---

### **3. @ToString**
- **What it does**: Generates a `toString()` method that includes all fields in the class by default.
- **Attributes**:
  - `exclude`: Exclude specific fields from the generated method.
  - `callSuper`: Include the `toString()` output of the superclass.
  - `onlyExplicitlyIncluded`: Includes only fields explicitly marked with `@ToString.Include`.
- **Why it is useful**: Saves time when debugging or logging by automatically creating a readable string representation.
- **When and where to use it**: Use on data classes where a custom `toString()` method would otherwise need to be written.

---

### **4. @EqualsAndHashCode**
- **What it does**: Generates `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods for the class, based on its fields.
- **Attributes**:
  - `exclude`: Exclude specific fields from the methods.
  - `callSuper`: Include the fields of the superclass in the methods.
  - `onlyExplicitlyIncluded`: Includes only fields marked with `@EqualsAndHashCode.Include`.
- **Why it is useful**: Ensures proper equality checks and compatibility with hashed collections like `HashMap` and `HashSet`.
- **When and where to use it**: Use on entities or data classes where equality depends on field values.

---

### **5. @Data**
- **What it does**: A shorthand for `@Getter`, `@Setter`, `@RequiredArgsConstructor`, `@ToString`, and `@EqualsAndHashCode`.
- **Why it is useful**: Convenient for simple classes like DTOs or POJOs that require basic functionality without custom logic.
- **When and where to use it**: Use for data classes where all fields are accessible and equality, hash code, and string representations are straightforward.

---

### **6. @NoArgsConstructor**
- **What it does**: Generates a no-argument constructor.
- **Attributes**:
  - `force`: Generates a constructor even if final fields without default values exist (sets them to default values like `0`, `false`, or `null`).
- **Why it is useful**: Required for frameworks like JPA, which often need a no-argument constructor.
- **When and where to use it**: Use on entity or model classes when a no-argument constructor is needed.

---

### **7. @AllArgsConstructor**
- **What it does**: Generates a constructor that accepts one argument for each field in the class.
- **Why it is useful**: Reduces boilerplate when creating classes with all fields as constructor parameters.
- **When and where to use it**: Use when you want a full constructor for dependency injection or value initialization.

---

### **8. @RequiredArgsConstructor**
- **What it does**: Generates a constructor that accepts arguments for all `final` fields or fields annotated with `@NonNull`.
- **Why it is useful**: Ensures proper initialization of immutable fields without boilerplate.
- **When and where to use it**: Use in classes with a mix of required (`final` or `@NonNull`) and optional fields.

---

### **9. @Value**
- **What it does**: Marks the class as immutable. Combines `@Getter`, `@AllArgsConstructor`, `@ToString`, `@EqualsAndHashCode`, and marks all fields as `private final`.
- **Why it is useful**: Enforces immutability for objects like configuration data or constants.
- **When and where to use it**: Use for classes that represent immutable data (e.g., DTOs or value objects).

---

### **10. @Builder**
- **What it does**: Implements the builder pattern for the class.
- **Why it is useful**: Provides a clean and readable way to construct complex objects with multiple optional or required fields.
- **When and where to use it**: Use for classes with many fields where constructors would be unwieldy.

---

### **11. @SneakyThrows**
- **What it does**: Allows methods to throw checked exceptions without explicitly declaring them.
- **Why it is useful**: Simplifies exception handling by bypassing the need for `try-catch` or `throws` declarations.
- **When and where to use it**: Use sparingly, as it can hide potential exceptions and make debugging harder.

---

### **12. @NonNull**
- **What it does**: Generates a null check for the annotated field or parameter.
- **Why it is useful**: Ensures that critical fields or method arguments are not null at runtime.
- **When and where to use it**: Use on fields, method parameters, or constructor arguments that must not be null.

---

### **13. @Log, @Slf4j, etc.**
- **What it does**: Generates a static logger instance for the class.
- **Variants**:
  - `@Log` (Java Util Logging)
  - `@Slf4j` (SLF4J)
  - `@Log4j2` (Log4j2)
  - `@CommonsLog` (Apache Commons Logging)
- **Why it is useful**: Simplifies the creation of logger instances for logging purposes.
- **When and where to use it**: Use at the class level to add a logging mechanism.

---

### **14. @Accessors**
- **What it does**: Allows customization of getter and setter behavior.
- **Attributes**:
  - `fluent`: Enables fluent accessors (e.g., `user.username("newName")`).
  - `chain`: Enables chaining setters (e.g., `user.setName("newName").setEmail("newEmail")`).
  - `prefix`: Strips prefixes like "m" or "is" from field names to generate method names.
- **Why it is useful**: Improves readability and flexibility of accessor methods.
- **When and where to use it**: Use when you want custom behavior for getters and setters.

---

### **15. @Cleanup**
- **What it does**: Automatically calls the `close()` method on a resource after it goes out of scope.
- **Why it is useful**: Reduces boilerplate for managing resources like streams or database connections.
- **When and where to use it**: Use in methods where resources must be closed explicitly.

---

### **16. @With**
- **What it does**: Generates "with" methods for creating copies of objects with one field changed.
- **Why it is useful**: Facilitates immutability by providing a way to create modified copies.
- **When and where to use it**: Use on immutable data classes to simplify creating variations of an object.

Lombok annotations drastically reduce boilerplate code and simplify Java development. However, always use them thoughtfully to maintain code readability and avoid over-reliance. Let me know if youâ€™d like to dive deeper into any of these!
